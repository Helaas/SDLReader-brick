# Page Prerendering Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive page prerendering system to improve page change performance on TG5040 and other platforms.

## Components Added

### 1. Core Prerendering Methods
- `prerenderPage(int pageNumber, int scale)` - Synchronous single page prerendering
- `prerenderAdjacentPages(int currentPage, int scale)` - Synchronous multi-page prerendering
- `prerenderAdjacentPagesAsync(int currentPage, int scale)` - Asynchronous background prerendering

### 2. Thread Management
- Added `std::thread m_prerenderThread` for background operations
- Added `std::atomic<bool> m_prerenderActive` for thread control
- Proper thread cleanup in destructor

### 3. Smart Prerendering Strategy
The async prerendering prioritizes pages in order of likely user navigation:
1. **Next page** (most likely navigation)
2. **Previous page** (back navigation)
3. **Page after next** (reading ahead)

### 4. Cache Integration
- Prerendered pages are stored in the existing display list cache
- Uses same cache key format: `{pageNumber, scale}`
- Cache is thread-safe with mutex protection

## Integration Points

### App.cpp Integration
```cpp
// After main page render completion
auto* muPdfDoc = dynamic_cast<MuPdfDocument*>(m_document.get());
if (muPdfDoc) {
    muPdfDoc->prerenderAdjacentPagesAsync(m_currentPage, m_currentScale);
}
```

### Thread Safety
- Background prerendering uses separate MuPDF context operations
- Atomic boolean for clean thread cancellation
- Proper thread joining in destructor

## Performance Benefits

### Expected Improvements
1. **Faster Page Navigation**: Next/previous pages are already cached
2. **Smooth Reading Experience**: Reduced page change latency
3. **Background Processing**: Prerendering doesn't block main UI thread
4. **Smart Caching**: Only prerenders likely-to-be-accessed pages

### TG5040 Specific Benefits
- Addresses reported slow page changes on TG5040
- Utilizes available processing power during idle time
- Maintains responsive user interface

## Technical Details

### Memory Management
- Uses existing cache eviction policies
- No additional memory overhead beyond cached pages
- Thread-safe access to shared cache

### Error Handling
- Graceful failure of individual prerender operations
- Background thread doesn't crash on prerender errors
- Continues main operation if prerendering fails

## Testing Status
- âœ… Compiles successfully on Mac platform
- âœ… Thread management implementation verified
- âœ… Integration with existing cache system
- ðŸ”„ TG5040 testing pending (requires target hardware)

## Usage
The prerendering system activates automatically during normal document viewing. No user intervention required - pages are prerendered in the background as the user navigates through the document.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Configurable Prerender Count**: Allow customizing how many pages ahead to prerender
2. **Zoom-Aware Prerendering**: Prerender at multiple zoom levels
3. **Priority Queue**: More sophisticated prerender prioritization
4. **Memory Pressure Handling**: Dynamic prerender adjustment based on available memory
