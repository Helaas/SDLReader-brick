# MuPDF 1.26.7 Upgrade Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Dockerfile Updates
- Updated from MuPDF 0.5 to 1.26.7
- MuPDF will be built from source and installed to `/usr/local/`
- Added workaround for C++20 compatibility issue with Debian Buster's GCC 8.3
- Modified Makelists to use C++17 instead of C++20

### 2. Makefile Updates  
- Updated library path from `/usr/local/opt/mupdf-tools/lib` to `/usr/local/lib`
- Added `/usr/local/include` to include path for headers

### 3. No Source Code Changes Needed
- The MuPDF API used in the codebase is compatible with 1.26.7
- All function calls (`fz_new_context`, `fz_open_document`, etc.) remain the same

## Build Process

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   cd ports/tg5040
   docker build -t tg5040-toolchain .
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/../..:/root/workspace" tg5040-toolchain /bin/bash -c "
   cd /root/workspace && make"
   ```

3. Create bundle:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/../..:/root/workspace" tg5040-toolchain /bin/bash -c "
   cd /root/workspace/ports/tg5040 && ./export_bundle.sh"
   ```

## Benefits of MuPDF 1.26.7

- Better performance
- Support for newer PDF features
- Improved memory management
- Enhanced error handling

## Technical Details

- MuPDF libraries are statically linked into the binary
- Binary size: ~41MB (stripped), includes embedded fonts
- Distribution package: ~37MB (compressed)
- C++17 compatibility ensured for older GCC versions

## Verified Working

✅ MuPDF 1.26.7 builds successfully  
✅ Project compiles without errors  
✅ Bundle export completes successfully  
✅ Final distribution package created  

## Potential Issues to Watch For

- Binary size might be larger with newer MuPDF
- Some edge cases with very old PDF files might behave differently
- Ensure Docker environment has sufficient build resources
